    "### Project Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The Italian Language VR Travel and Language game will use a virtual environment that is accessible from mobile and web devices that will enable a student to practice the language skills being taught in a begining Italian class.  The student will virtually travel to Itally and be challenged with the common issues that a visitor to the country would have.  Like land at the Leonard Da Vinci Airport and be challenged to navigate the environment and get the their hotel room. There would be two play modes. Indivual play and practice, and a class version that is an enhanvment to in person or online classes for Italian Language Learning."

    "\n",
    "The purpose  of the project is to get the students practicing critical language skills outside of the class room. The scenes in the game match those of common experiences of travelers to the country. The student could track their own progress and the instructor can track the classes progress. Then in a later phase there would be a study to show that this technique increases engagement and improves the learning outcome for the course."

    "### Business Case\n",
    "\n",
    "This kind of practice of game based learning can solve and issue locally at Rutgers University, but the business case is much wider. Individuals traveling to a country can orient themselves to the new country and language as a stand alone product. With the instructor/class tracking features it would be useful not just the Italian Department at Rutges University but also any language department that is trying to enhance and improve the learning experience for their students as well. Currently, their isn't a product that does this in the same way as the approached adopted here.\n"
